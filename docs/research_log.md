## 2026-09-24 — Project kickoff / V0 scope

**Goal:** QB Motion Atlas — decompose a throwing motion into phases (load, stride, arm cock, acceleration, release, follow-through), extract per-phase biomechanical features, and compute similarity against a curated NFL QB reference database, using both interpretable hand-engineered features and (later) a learned embedding.

**V0 exit criteria (proof of concept):** On a small seed set of 3 QBs' publicly available coaching-breakdown clips —
1. MediaPipe pose extraction produces usable landmark tracking.
2. A heuristic (velocity/angle-threshold) phase segmenter produces boundaries reasonably close to hand-labeled ground truth.
3. A hand-engineered weighted-distance similarity score puts same-QB throws closer together than cross-QB throws.

If all three hold on the seed set, the core technical bet has legs and V1 (full 8–10 QB dataset, validation, DB, API, frontend, deployment) is worth building. If not, the phase taxonomy, feature set, or pose-extraction approach needs rework before scaling up.

**Environment:** Python 3.11.9, dependencies pinned in `requirements.txt` (mediapipe 1.0.1, opencv-python 5.0.0.93, numpy 2.4.6, scipy 1.17.1, pandas 3.0.6, matplotlib 3.11.2), installed cleanly into `.venv` with no conflicts.
